Sometimes 0 is a dummy value, so we should check that out. Judging by the fact that the mode 11 is set 739 times, the distance might not be exactly the distance from the city center, but the mean distance of a suburb perhaps from the city center. We should check this out.\n",

    "- Parking: same as for bedrooms, but here 1026 samples with no parking spaces is not surprising.\n",

    "- BuildingArea: Also extremely skewed to the right, due to the maximum size of 44515 m2. This sounds improbable, so we might want to remove that one. Also there are 17 samples with 0 building area, which also does not sound good.\n",
